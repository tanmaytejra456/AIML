# Project Statement: EduFuzzy

## 1. Problem Statement
In traditional academic environments, student performance evaluation is often rigid and binary. A student with **74% attendance** is often treated identically to one with **40% attendance** if the threshold is 75%, leading to unfair detention or lack of early intervention. Similarly, grading systems based on strict cutoffs fail to capture the **holistic** academic risk of a student who might be struggling in one area but excelling in another.

There is a lack of intelligent systems that can:
1.  Handle the **uncertainty** and **vagueness** inherent in human performance metrics (e.g., "Poor" attendance vs. "Average" marks).
2.  Provide **early warning signals** before a student actually fails.
3.  Group students based on **behavioral patterns** rather than just raw scores.

## 2. Scope of the Project
**EduFuzzy** aims to build an intelligent decision-support system that transitions from "Crisp Logic" (Pass/Fail) to "Fuzzy Logic" (Degree of Risk). 

The scope includes:
*   **Input Processing:** Ingesting raw academic data (Attendance %, Internal Marks).
*   **Fuzzy Inference:** Applying fuzzy set theory to map inputs to linguistic variables (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
*   **Risk Quantification:** Generating a precise **Academic Risk Score (0-100%)**.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Forecasting future Final Exam scores using Linear Regression.
*   **Unsupervised Clustering:** Automatically categorizing students into behavioral groups (e.g., "High Achievers", "At-Risk") using K-Means.
*   **reporting:** Visualizing these insights for faculty and administrators.
*   **Symbolic Reasoning:** Implementing a logic-based prototype using Prolog to validate the rule definitions against a knowledge base.


## 3. Target Users
*   **Faculty & Class Advisors:** To identify "at-risk" students weeks before the final exams, allowing for timely counseling or remedial classes.
*   **University Administrators:** To generate automated, unbiased performance reports for entire departments.
*   **Students:** To view their own "Risk Meter" and understand how much improvement is needed to reach a "Safe" zone.

## 4. High-Level Features
*   **Fuzzy Inference Engine:** A core module that applies linguistic rules (e.g., *IF Attendance is Low AND Marks are Average THEN Risk is High*) to calculate a risk score [1][6].
*   **Grade Predictor:** A machine learning module that uses historical data trends to predict future exam performance [3].
*   **Student Clustering:** An unsupervised learning feature that segments students into distinct groups without manual labeling [4].
*   **Risk Dashboard:** A visual representation of the class's risk distribution, highlighting critical cases.
*   **Automated Alert System:** Classifies students into **Safe**, **Monitor**, and **Critical** categories for immediate action.
*   **Prolog Inference Module:** A separate logic layer that processes facts (Student Data) against strict Horn Clause rules to verify risk categories (Critical/Monitor/Safe).
